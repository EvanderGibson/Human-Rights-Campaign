	  <div class="col-sm-3"><p class="Btext textbground">Survivors of human trafficking often face a heartbreaking and deeply unjust reality even after escaping their traffickers, in the loss of custody rights. The trauma they’ve endured is compounded by legal battles that frequently do not account for the abuse they’ve suffered. Alarmingly, statistics reveal that 30% of survivors are forced to engage in custody battles with their former exploiters, people who once trafficked or abused them. Even worse is that of those survivors who find themselves in these legal battles, 62% ultimately lose custody of their children to their trafficker.</p></div>
